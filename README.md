# Mechanics_of_Solids-_-Project
This GitHub repository hosts a project that aims to compare the deflection shapes and stress distributions predicted by two fundamental theories: the Theory of Elastica and the Euler-Bernoulli Theorem. The project focuses on analyzing the behavior of a cantilever beam subjected to a point load, utilizing these two theories as theoretical frameworks.

The primary objective of this project is to explore and understand the distinct assumptions underlying each theory and how they influence the predicted beam shapes and stress distributions. By conducting a comparative analysis, we aim to gain insights into the strengths, limitations, and applicability of each theory in practical engineering scenarios.

Key features of the project include:

Implementation of mathematical models based on the Theory of Elastica and the Euler-Bernoulli Theorem to predict beam deflection shapes and stress distributions.
Visualization of the predicted deflection shapes and stress distributions using appropriate plotting techniques.
Comparative analysis of the results obtained from the two theories, highlighting differences and similarities.
Discussion of the theoretical assumptions and their implications on the accuracy of predictions.

This project serves as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners in the field of structural engineering, providing insights into the theoretical foundations of beam deflection and stress analysis. The GitHub repository contains code implementations, documentation, and supplementary materials to support the analysis and facilitate further exploration of the topic.
